MAKEFILE

FOR EVERY C FILE OBJECT FILE MUST BE CREATED

SYNTAX

TARGET: DEPENDENCIES

RULE 1

IF A C FILE IS PART OF A SHARED LIBRARY THEN IT SHOULD BE COMPILED LIKE

FILE NAME.o: FILE NAME.C
	gcc –c -fpic File name.c

Because pic means position independent code and dynamic library code is only
loaded when it is required


Rule 2

If a file is not part of a shared library but it is used in another file

FILE NAME.o: FILE NAME.C
	gcc –c File name.c


Rule 3 static library

If a file’s function are must to be used then it must be part of static library
For that

Static library name.a: .o file of c file whose functions are discussed
	ar cr same name as written in red color c file name


Rule 4 shared library

Sharedlibraryname.so: filename.o whose functions are part
	gcc –shared –o Sharedlibraryname.so filename.o


Rule 5

Clear:
	rm *.o and the name of libraries which were created

And the main thing the exe file

Test: the libraries and the main file from where the execution will start
	gcc –o Test maincode.o, -L. lstatic libraryname.a without lib

With static library only

Test: the libraries and the main file from where the execution will start
	gcc –o Test maincode.o, -L. lstatic libraryname.a without lib, -wl filepath –l(libraryname.so)

With static library and dynamic library
